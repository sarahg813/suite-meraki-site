        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          The area treated may show redness and swelling and the color will look
          dark and intense - this is quite normal.
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          You may notice whiteness or blanching around the area, this is quite
          normal and will subside within 12 hours. If you find any lymphatic
          fluid or blood weeping, you can gently clean the area with saline,
          cool boiled water, and use gauze to gently blot dry to remove any
          moisture.{" "}
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          Additional treatments cannot be undertaken until the area has
          completely healed. A 4-6 week healing time is required before any more
          work can be undertaken.
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          Keep the area clean by washing with freshly washed hands and mild
          soap. Do not use a washcloth or sponge to remove soap. Simply splash
          with water. Do not use cleansing creams, acne cleansers, or
          astringents. Use a mild, natural soap.
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          With freshly washed hands or a q-tip, apply a fine layer of aftercare
          balm to the treated area. Too little is better than too much. Blot off
          excess with a clean tissue. Repeat this procedure up to 3 times a day
          if the area feels tight.
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          In order to let your treated area to heal well avoid makeup on the
          area, the gym, sauna, or pool for 7 days.
        </Typography>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          Once the area has healed completely, approximately one week, consider
          using a waterproof total sunblock when going out in the sun to stop
          the color fading.
        </Typography>
        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          Strong chemicals or glycolic acid/peels of any kind may cause the
          pigment to lighten. Please check with your consultant if you have any
          doubt.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Do not pick or pull at the treated area as it will result in pigment
          loss. Allow it to flake off by itself. If it is removed before it is
          ready the pigment underneath it can be pulled out. <br />
          You will go through three healing phases:

          <li>Peel</li>
          <li>Fade</li>
        </ol>

        <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
          After the fine scabbing has sloughed away you will see a different hue
          to the color implanted.{" "}
